This was a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This particular iteration is from Bytegrad's 7 hour tutorial:

- [Fresh React Portfolio Website (Next.js App, Framer Motion, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Email)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUKptmUVIBM)
- [ByteGrad/portfolio-website](https://github.com/ByteGrad/portfolio-website/)

## Getting Started

The development server is run using:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
